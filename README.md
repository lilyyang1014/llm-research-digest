🛠️ Configuration The script uses several configuration variables that can be modified:

```python
# LLM-related keywords for initial filtering  
KEYWORDS = ['llm', 'large language model', 'language model',
            'foundation model', 'pretrained language model',
            'transformer', 'generative ai'
            ]  

# Target date range for paper search (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format)  
TARGET_DATE_START = "20250411000000"  
TARGET_DATE_END = "20250411235959"  

# Target institutions for affiliation matching
TARGET_INSTITUTIONS = [ "Stanford", "Stanford University",
                        "Princeton University", "UC Berkeley",
                        "University of California, Berkeley",
                        "Berkeley", "CMU", "Carnegie Mellon University",
                        "Carnegie Mellon", "NVIDIA Research", "NVIDIA",
                        "Google Deepmind", "Deepmind", "Google", "OpenAI",
                        "University of Washington", "Cornell University",
                        "University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign", "UIUC",
                        "Allen Institute for AI", "AI2"
                        ]
